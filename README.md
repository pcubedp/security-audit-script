# 🛡️ Linux Security Audit Toolkit

A modular and extensible **Linux Security Audit Toolkit** written in Bash. This toolkit helps you quickly identify potential security misconfigurations and vulnerabilities on your Linux system through automated scans.

- Along with tons of comments I have added in the process of learning about bash and linux systems, please explore the scripts and share your thoughts, learnings and maybe pull requests too :)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

- Bash (>= 4.x)
- `awk`, `grep`, `find`, `ss`, `ps`, and standard GNU/Linux core utilities
- Root access recommended for full scan

---

### 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pcubedp/security-audit-script.git
cd security-audit-script
cd scripts
chmod +x run-audit.sh
````

---

## 🛠️ Usage

Run the main script to start the audit:

```bash
sudo ./run-audit.sh
```

You will see a menu like:

```
Select an option:
1. Run ALL audits
2. Password Policy Audit
3. User Accounts Audit
4. World Writable Files Audit
5. SUID/SGID Files Audit
6. Open Ports & Listening Services Audit
7. Running Processes Audit
8. Cron Jobs Audit
9. SSH Configuration Audit
0. Exit
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

* The scripts do not make any changes to your system.
* Review the output carefully to identify potential security risks.
* Disable unnecessary services (like `sshd`) on systems where remote access isn't required.

---

## 💡 Customization

Each script is modular and can be run independently or modified for specific environments (e.g., server-only checks, container audits).
